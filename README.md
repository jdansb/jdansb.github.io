# Jhordan Silveira de Borba
Welcome to my humble personal website.

You may be interested in my [**personal projects**](https://jdansb.github.io/pessoais) or the [**list of tools**](https://jdansb.github.io/ferramentas) that I consider useful for a scientist. If you would like to know more about me, you can read my resume below. And if you're specifically interested in my quantum mechanics study material (under development) you can follow its current status [here](https://github.com/jdansb/jdansb.github.io/blob/main/Arquivos/DLC.pdf).

# CURRICULUM

I have a degree in physics from the Federal University of Santa Maria (UFSM), where I conducted research in quantum computing and artificial intelligence. During this time, I worked with the Quantum Information and Emergent Phenomena (QIEP) group under the guidance of Dr. [Jonas Maziero](https://sites.google.com/site/jonasmaziero/), developing my undergraduate thesis, "Implementation of Machine Learning Techniques in Quantum Computers," which was supported by grants from CNPq and FAPERGS. Previously, I worked in the Laboratory of Electronic Structure of Energies (LEELMAT) and the High Energy Division (DAE), where I studied molecular dynamics and hydrodynamics, respectively.

I also have a master's degree in the graduate program in Physics at UFRGS with a scholarship from CNPq (National Council for Scientific and Technological Development). I developed my research project in the Sociophysics, Econophysics, and Complex Networks group, with an emphasis on ecology, under the guidance of Dr. [Sebastián Gonçalves](https://www.if.ufrgs.br/~sebas/) (UFRGS) and with the assistance of Dr. [Fabiana Laguna](https://fabianalaguna.wordpress.com/) (CONICET - Argentina).

I am currently pursuing a PhD at UFRGS as a CAPES (Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel) scholarship recipient, where I continue to work in the same research group under the guidance of Dr. Sebastián Gonçalves and Dr. [Celia Anteneodo](https://www.fis.puc-rio.br/colaborador/celia-anteneodo/) (PUC-Rio), researching mainly the distribution of wealth within the social structure of capitalism.

## Extras

Although I believe that we cannot be reduced to grades, I took the Unified Physics Exam (EUF) in 2020 and was ranked in the fourth quartile (Q4), that is, among the 25% of students with the highest grades. I also obtained the highest grade (A) in all graduate courses. As an autistic person who had to deal with depression during my undergraduate studies, I consider this an achievement.

# Experience

**Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS)**:  Research (PhD level) <br>
*2023-current*<br>
My current experience, as a CAPES scholarship recipient, is that I continue to work with research group  Sociophysics, Econophysics, and Complex Networks, but now motivated by the issue of inequality in the distribution of wealth and income under capitalism, I investigate its social structures and how these structures present, as an emerging property, the patterns of wealth distribution that we can observe in different countries.

**Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS)**:  Research (Master's level) <br>
*2021-2023*<br>
During this period, I was a CNPq scholarship holder and developed my research in the Sociophysics, Econophysics, and Complex Networks group. There, I worked on a project motivated by the Patagonian ecosystem, aiming to better understand the dynamics between different species of native fauna and ecosystem degradation.

**Federal University of Santa Maria (UFSM)**:  Research (Undergraduate level) <br>
*2019-2020*<br>
During this period, I received two scholarships, one from FAPERGS and one from CNPQ. In 2019, during the first project, I worked at the Electronic Structure of Materials Laboratory (LEELMAT), where I studied the modeling and dynamics of the LOXL2 enzyme. In 2020, I joined the Quantum Information and Emergent Phenomena (QIEP) research group, where I studied implementing an artificial intelligence model in quantum computers.

**Federal University of Rio Grande (FURG)**:   Research (Undergraduate level)<br>
*2013-2015*<br>
During this period, I received scholarships from the university and from the funding agencies FAPERGS and CNPQ. These opportunities allowed me to begin my career as a researcher while studying particle physics and learning about the research profession.

**Note**: A depressive episode, which culminated in my autism diagnosis, occurred between my time at FURG and UFSM. Despite this, I completed one and a half years of information technology studies remotely at UNINTER (2016–2017) and one semester of computational engineering at FURG (2018). Before FURG, I spent another year and a half studying information technology at URCAMP (2011–2012), where I completed an internship in computer maintenance. Before that, I attended UNIPAMPA for a short time to study physics (2011), where I discovered that I wanted to be a researcher. At that time, however, I didn't realize that my greatest challenge was social, not educational. I am also currently enrolled in a degree program in Spanish language and literature, which I am pursuing concurrently with my PhD.

## Non-profit experience
**Federal University of Rio Grande (FURG)**: Developer <br>
*2018*<br>
During this time, I collaborated on the development of the game Água (Water), and I was responsible for rebuilding it for mobile devices. The project focused on raising children's awareness of the importance of water.

**Federal University of Rio Grande (FURG)**: Research (Undergraduate level)<br>
*2016*<br>
I collaborated with the high energy physics research group at FURG (ASTROFURG – Division of High Energy [D.A.E.]). I studied hydrodynamic instabilities and managed the cluster.

**Federal University of Rio Grande (FURG)**: Member of the Physics degree students union<br>
*2014-2015*<br>
In the first year, I worked in event organization. The following year, I transitioned to student assistance and social movements.

## Study notes
Proceed with caution; these notes are subject to errors due to the natural learning process. These notes are the result of my personal studies on certain topics. I thought they might be useful to other students.

### Current projects:

- [Griffiths DLC](https://github.com/jdansb/jdansb.github.io/tree/main/Griffiths%20) - In a nutshell, it's basically a review of quantum mechanics based on David J. Griffiths' Introduction to Quantum Mechanics (3rd Edition), where I try to open up all the accounts, examples and some problems in a straightforward way. (In progress, Portuguese)

### Completed projects:
-  [Ecology Wiki](https://fiscomp.if.ufrgs.br/index.php/Ecologia) - My master's research is what got me started with Wiki. I shared part of my introductory studies in the field by investigating different mathematical and computational models (2022, Portuguese).
- [Computational Methods B](https://fiscomp.if.ufrgs.br/index.php/M%C3%A9todos_computacionais#M.C3.A9todos_Computacionais_B) -  These contributions were made during my teaching internship in the same discipline. I mainly contributed to methods for numerically solving ordinary differential equations (2022, Portuguese).
- [Partial Solutions Manual Herbert B. Goldstein 3RD ED](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/358249174_Partial_Solutions_Manual_Herbert_B_Goldstein_3RD_ED) - This is a detailed partial solution that was done collectively during the master's program in Classical Mechanics (Herbert B. Goldstein, 3rd ed. Chapters 1, 2, 8, and 9). (2021, English).
- [Introduction to Quantum Computing](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/352899034_Introducao_a_computacao_quantica) - These study notes, written during the production of the undergraduate final thesis, became part of the final work in a more succinct and revised version. However, I believe these "expanded notes" are a good introductory reference. They do not presuppose knowledge of quantum mechanics, only the necessary mathematical tools. (2020, Portuguese).
- [Introduction to Computational Fluid Dynamics](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/352898989_Introducao_a_Fluidodinamica_Computacional) - I wrote these study notes during my undergraduate studies as part of my scientific initiation. They cover the deduction of hydrodynamic equations in two ways: the more classical approach and the statistical method. Additionally, they introduce the PLUTO computational tool and analyze a few particular cases (2017, Portuguese).
